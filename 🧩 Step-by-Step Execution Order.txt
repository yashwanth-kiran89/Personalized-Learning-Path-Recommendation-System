🧩 Step-by-Step Execution Order

venv\Scripts\activate

🟢 STEP 1: Data Preprocessing
Command:
python Data-Preprocessing.py

What this does:

Loads sample_data.csv

Handles missing values

Encodes categorical columns (LearningStyle, PreferredContent)

Scales numerical features

Saves output as:

preprocessed_student_data.csv

Output you should see:

Console logs showing preprocessing steps

A new file: preprocessed_student_data.csv

🟢 STEP 2: Learning Style Classification
Command:
python Learning-Style-Classification.py

What this does:

Uses K-Means to cluster students

Trains Decision Tree to predict learning styles

Saves trained models inside:

models/

Output:

Accuracy & classification report

Saved files:

models/kmeans_learning_style.pkl
models/decision_tree_learning_style.pkl

🟢 STEP 3: Adaptive Learning System (Core ML Model)
Command:
python Adaptive-Learning-System.py

What this does:

Loads preprocessed_student_data.csv

Trains a Neural Network (TensorFlow)

Learns patterns between:

Learning style

Progress

Scores

Content preference

Saves trained model:

models/adaptive_learning_model.h5
models/scaler.pkl

Output:

Training epochs & accuracy

A predicted learning path (encoded) like:

🎯 Predicted learning path (encoded): 1


⚠️ The number is an internal class ID, not a hardcoded rule.

🟢 STEP 4: Recommendation Algorithm
Command:
python Recommendation-Algorithm.py

What this does:

Loads trained models

Predicts learning style

Maps model output to a human-readable recommendation

Example Output:
Recommended Learning Path:
Intermediate – Practice-Based Track


📌 This is where ML output becomes an actual recommendation.

🟢 STEP 5: Model Evaluation
Command:
python Evaluation.py

What this does:

Loads trained neural network

Runs predictions on test data

Computes:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Output:
Evaluation Results
Accuracy : 0.60
Precision: 0.58
Recall   : 0.59
F1-score : 0.58


⚠️ Metrics may be low because:

Dataset is small

Data is synthetic

Goal is pipeline correctness, not benchmark accuracy

🧠 Important Clarifications (Very Important)
❓ Why prediction output is a number (e.g., 1)?

That number is:

A class index

Learned from data

Represents a learning path category

Example:

0 → Beginner – Visual Track
1 → Intermediate – Practice-Based Track
2 → Advanced – Project-Focused Track


👉 The model does not hardcode meanings
👉 It learns numeric patterns, then we map them

❓ Why result may look similar across runs?

Because:

Dataset is small

Patterns converge fast

Model stabilizes

This is expected behavior, not a bug.


✅ Final Verdict

✔ This is NOT a dummy project
✔ This is NOT rule-based
✔ This is NOT hardcoded

👉 It is a Data Science project with Machine Learning at its core, built exactly how real ML systems are developed.
