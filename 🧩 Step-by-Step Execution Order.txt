🧩 Step-by-Step Execution Order 

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

🟢 STEP 1: Data Preprocessing
Command:
python Data-Preprocessing.py

What this does:

Loads sample_data.csv

Handles missing values

Encodes categorical columns (LearningStyle, PreferredContent)

Scales numerical features

Saves output as:

preprocessed_student_data.csv

Output you should see:

Console logs showing preprocessing steps

A new file: preprocessed_student_data.csv

🟢 STEP 2: Learning Style Classification
Command:
python Learning-Style-Classification.py

What this does:

Uses K-Means to cluster students

Trains Decision Tree to predict learning styles

Saves trained models inside:

models/

Output:

Accuracy & classification report

Saved files:

models/kmeans_learning_style.pkl
models/decision_tree_learning_style.pkl

🟢 STEP 3: Adaptive Learning System (Core ML Model)
Command:
python Adaptive-Learning-System.py

What this does:

Loads preprocessed_student_data.csv

Trains a Neural Network (TensorFlow)

Learns patterns between:

Learning style

Progress

Scores

Content preference

Saves trained model:

models/adaptive_learning_model.h5
models/scaler.pkl

Output:

Training epochs & accuracy

A predicted learning path (encoded) like:

🎯 Predicted learning path (encoded): 1


⚠️ The number is an internal class ID, not a hardcoded rule.

🟢 STEP 4: Recommendation Algorithm
Command:
python Recommendation-Algorithm.py

What this does:

Loads trained models

Predicts learning style

Maps model output to a human-readable recommendation

Example Output:
Recommended Learning Path:
Intermediate – Practice-Based Track


📌 This is where ML output becomes an actual recommendation.

🟢 STEP 5: Model Evaluation
Command:
python Evaluation.py

What this does:

Loads trained neural network

Runs predictions on test data

Computes:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

F1-Score

Output:
Evaluation Results
Accuracy : 0.60
Precision: 0.58
Recall   : 0.59
F1-score : 0.58
